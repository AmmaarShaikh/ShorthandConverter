# Shorthand Converter

## The Goal
In this lab we'll be looking at how to convert short hand and english explanations of html components into actual html code. This will be extremely useful as we move further in the course as it will allow us to easily and succinctly describe html elements in a consistent way.

## The Lab

#### Introduction to Shorthand

#### Elements to Create

TODO: add introductory text around this, clarify shorthand specifics, add image of finished product
Shorthands:

div#id.area
  img.background-image
  h1#title
div#body.area
  div#notstarted.todolist
    h2.taskTitle
    p.task
    p.task
    p.task
  div#inprogress.todolist
    h2.taskTitle
    p.task
    p.task
    p.task
  div#complete.todolist
    h2.taskTitle
    p.task
    p.task
    p.task

questions: how to signify parents in shorthand?


## Extensions

1. Pair up with a partner in your class.
2. Take a few minutes to come up with some additional html elements and style them in your own code.
3. Write down the shorthand explanations of the html that you've added to your page.
4. Send your partner the css rules to add and the shorthand explanation of the html that you want them to create. (If you want to make an added challenge, try to describe the selectors and rules that they need to complete in english also. For example: "select all h1 elements and color them green")
5. Add the html elements and css rules that your partner described with shorthand and gave to you!

This will let you test how well you can communicate about this kind of code with your peers and will help you stretch and make your page even more interesting!
